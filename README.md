# Franc for iOS
Franc was an app built for HS Hacks to help democratize the stock market. The main functionality
is a feature that gives the user the top 10 stocks that they should invest in on NASDAQ. Along with this, 
the app allows the user to use Inqora(https://inqora.com/) to connect with other investors about potential investments, and Robinhood to add the capability of purchasing stocks. We are still developing the app for launch, with one round of beta testing already complete. Stay tuned for a launch on the app store, and an Android and web 
version.
